* papers
** rsyscall: A cross-process syscall API for Linux
** cross-host operations with rsyscall
** asynchronous IO with rsyscall thread pool (flexsc style)
* what to do after writing
1. send to labs team at TS for review
2. send to fork paper guy for review
3. send to professors as Kai says and ask about research opportunities
* misc other references
