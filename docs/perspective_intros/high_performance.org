- I want my code to go fast.
* rsyscall decouples language concurrency and kernel parallelism
You can be explicitly parallel without being concurrent.

Also, you can send your syscalls to another process to execute them while your main process continues running,
reducing the locality hit of entering the kernel, ala FlexSC.
