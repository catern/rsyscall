The single-threaded parts of the rsyscall library
are a low-level interface to the Linux kernel in Python.

When used with a single thread,
rsyscall provides interfaces to all the same functionality as the Python standard library.

rsyscall also provides interfaces to Linux features which are not in the Python standard library.
For example, inotify and rtnetlink.

All operations in rsyscall happen through methods on a `Thread` object,
or one of the objects contained within a `Thread`.
In this tutorial, we will operate only in terms of a single pre-existing thread, received as an argument;
read the [[file:multi_threaded.org][multi-threaded tutorial]] for more on creation of `Thread`s.
* Initial example
An example rsyscall program is the following:
#+BEGIN_SRC python
from rsyscall import Thread
from rsyscall.unistd import Pipe

async def f(thr: Thread, pipe: Pipe) -> None:
    # write some data to memory
    in_data_ptr = await thr.ptr(b"hello world")
    # write that data to the write-end of the pipe
    written_ptr, remaining_ptr = await pipe.write.write(in_data_ptr)
    # read that data from the read-end of the pipe
    read_ptr, unused_ptr = await pipe.read.read(written_ptr)
    if read_ptr.bytesize() != in_data_ptr.bytesize():
        raise Exception("unexpected partial write or read happened")
    # read the data from memory into a Python bytes object
    print(await read_ptr.read())
#+END_SRC

This function writes "hello world" to a pipe,
reads that same data back out from the pipe,
and prints that data.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from rsyscall import Thread
from rsyscall.unistd import Pipe

async def f(thr: Thread, pipe: Pipe) -> None:
#+END_SRC

We receive a thread as an argument;
as stated above, we will only work with a single pre-existing thread in this tutorial.

We also receive a pipe as an argument, produced elsewhere by a call to the pipe() system call.
The Pipe class contains the two file descriptor ends of the pipe in the "read" and "write" fields.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
    # write some data to memory
    in_data_ptr = await thr.ptr(b"hello world")
#+END_SRC

In rsyscall, syscalls that operate on memory take a Pointer argument.
Any data that you want to pass to a syscall must be first turned into a Pointer
before the syscall can be made.
Pointers are garbage collected, so we don't need to worry about freeing it.

Here we use the "ptr" method, which takes some data,
and returns a Pointer to memory containing that data.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
    # write that data to the write-end of the pipe
    written_ptr, remaining_ptr = await pipe.write.write(in_data_ptr)
#+END_SRC

We then call the `write` syscall with our new Pointer,
on the write-end of the pipe.
Pointers know the size (and the type) of the data they point to,
so we don't provide a size argument to `write`;
the size is simply pulled out of the Pointer.

Returned to us from `write` is a tuple of two Pointers; the original Pointer we passed in, split into two.
The first element of the tuple is a Pointer to the data that was successfully written;
the second element of the tuple is a Pointer to any data that was left un-written.
These two Pointers are adjacent,
and it's possible for us to combine them again and reuse the larger pointer,
or continue to use them each separately.
The original Pointer passed in to `write` is no longer usable,
since it has been split into the two Pointers returned back out.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
    # read that data from the read-end of the pipe
    read_ptr, unused_ptr = await pipe.read.read(written_ptr)
#+END_SRC

We then call the `read` syscall on the read-end of the pipe.
We reuse the `written_ptr` pointer as a buffer to read into,
so we don't have to allocate more memory.
We know that the `written_ptr` pointer is exactly the right size for reading out the data that is currently in the pipe,
since it in fact points to the original copy of the data that is currently in the pipe.
This is true even if there was a partial write, or if no data was written at all.
This is only marginally useful for this function,
but it demonstrates the kind of reasoning that can be done with this interface.

Returned to us from `read` is again a tuple of two Pointers, split from the Pointer passed in.
The first element of the tuple is a Pointer to the part of the buffer that contains data from the pipe;
the second element of the tuple is a Pointer to the unused portion of the buffer.
Again, the original pointer is no longer usable,
since it has been split into these two returned Pointers.
If we tried to use the original pointer,
we'd get a Python-level exception about an invalid pointer before any syscall is made.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
    if read_ptr.size() != in_data_ptr.size():
        raise Exception("unexpected partial write or read happened")
#+END_SRC

We then check whether the read data is equal in length to the original data we tried to write in.
If it isn't, then either a partial write or a partial read must have happened;
we could have retried to write the full amount of data,
but we choose not to in this example.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
    # read the data from memory into a Python bytes object
    print(await read_ptr.read())
#+END_SRC

Then, finally, we read the pointer returned from the `read` syscall;
this reads the data from memory into a Python object depending on the type of the pointer.
In this case, the pointer is a pointer to a bytestring, so we'll get back a bytestring,
which we then print.
* `read`, `write`, and other similar syscalls return tuples of pointers
This general pattern of passing one Pointer and returning a pair of Pointers applies to many similar syscalls in rsyscall.

The traditional POSIX interface to Linux returns a number of bytes from `write` and many other syscalls.
Then the user is responsible for determining what that implies about the state of the buffer passed in.
Depending on the syscall,
this might tell us what part of the buffer has been written out and what part was not written,
or this might tell us what part of the buffer contains valid data and what part contains garbage,
or any other number of things.
The user is responsible for only operating on the part of the buffer that is in the desired state.

Rather than delegate this responsibility to the user,
rsyscall splits the pointer in two;
one pointer returned was completely written out, or completely contains valid data,
and the other pointer returned was not at all written out, or contains no useful data,
or whatever the semantics of that specific syscall are.

This reduces the possibility of error in interpretation,
while still allowing for arbitrary manipulations of the buffer,
and makes a number of use cases simpler.

For example, to write an entire buffer out, a simple loop as follows will suffice:
#+BEGIN_SRC python
remaining = to_write
while remaining.size() > 0:
  _, remaining = await fd.write(remaining)
#+END_SRC

The resulting pointers are independently garbage-collected,
so you may save just one of the pointers and continue to use it,
and the other pointer will be freed and its space reused.

After a split,
the pointers may be merged back together so that the whole buffer may be reused.
For example:
#+BEGIN_SRC python
read_buf, rest = await fd.read(await thr.malloc(bytes, 4096))
while read_buf.size() > 0:
  print(await read_buf.read())
  read_buf, rest = await fd.read(read_buf.merge(rest))
#+END_SRC

In general, any two pointers that are adjacent in memory may be merged into a single allocation.

This style applies to any syscall that takes a pointer and returns information about what part of that pointer was used.
Consult the documentation for more details about specific syscalls.
* `malloc` and memory management
  An already-created `Pipe` was passed in to our initial example function.
  It was created using the `pipe` system call.

  The `pipe` system call, along with many others, is passed a buffer into which it writes its output.

  To allocate such an unitialized buffer, we can use `malloc`.
  Note again that pointers are garbage collected, so manual freeing is unnecessary.

  For example:
#+BEGIN_SRC python
async def make_pipe(thr: Thread) -> Pipe:
    buf = await thr.malloc(Pipe)
    written_buf = await thr.task.pipe(buf)
    return await written_buf.read()

# or, more concisely:
async def make_pipe(thr: Thread) -> Pipe:
    return await (await thr.task.pipe(await thr.malloc(Pipe))).read()
#+END_SRC

`malloc` takes as its first argument a type to allocate a buffer for.
If that type needs a fixed-size buffer, no further arguments are needed.
If the type's buffer can be of variable size, then malloc requires a second argument,
which is the size in bytes of the buffer to allocate.
* `ptr`
As `malloc` is the typical way to allocate an unitialized buffer that will be written by a syscall,
`ptr` is the typical way to get some value into memory as a pointer that can be read by a syscall.

`ptr` takes a value of any of the supported types
and returns a Pointer to memory containing the serialization of that value.

For example:
#+BEGIN_SRC python
from rsyscall import Path
from rsyscall.fcntl import O

fd = await thr.task.open(await thr.ptr(Path("/dev/null")), O.RDONLY)
#+END_SRC

We get a pointer to the path "/dev/null" in memory,
then call the "open" syscall on that path to get a file descriptor.
* Header-based organization
  Many constants and structures are involved in the Linux API.
  The layout of these constants in rsyscall follows the headers exported by Linux.

  For example,
  #+BEGIN_SRC python
  from rsyscall.sys.socket import AF, SOCK

  sock = await thr.task.socket(AF.INET, SOCK.INET, 0)
  #+END_SRC

  This allows consulting normal manpages
  to determine how to use various constants and structures,
  and what "headers" should be imported to use those constants and structures.

  In general, if something is defined as `NAMESPACE_PREFIX_SOME_FLAG` in the Linux header `foo/bar.h`,
  then it can be imported as `NAMESPACE_PREFIX` from `rsyscall.foo.bar` and used as `NAMESPACE_PREFIX.SOME_FLAG`.

  Sometimes a manpage will mention several headers;
  in general, the last header mentioned is the header that actually defines the associated constants and structs,
  both in the Linux headers and in rsyscall.

  Structs, to comply with normal Python practices, are camel-cased.
  So, for example, `struct sockaddr_in` from `"netinet/in.h"` can be imported and used as follows:

  #+BEGIN_SRC python
  from rsyscall.netinet.in_ import SockaddrIn

  await sock.bind(await thr.ptr(SockaddrIn(53, "127.0.0.1")))
  #+END_SRC

  Some headers or constants (such as "netinet/in.h") collide with Python keywords ("in");
  they are suffixed with a single underscore to disambiguate them.

  In some cases, to improve type safety and usability,
  we will intentionally deviate from how the Linux headers define things.
  `struct msghdr` is one example; it is used differently by `sendmsg` and `recvmsg`,
  and in the case of `recvmsg` also serves as an out-parameter.
  Therefore, it is represented with three classes, all in `rsyscall.sys.socket`,
  `SendMsghdr`, `RecvMsghdr`, and `RecvMsghdrOut`.

  Consult the rsyscall documentation for specific headers for more details about how to use those headers.

  Types which are unique to rsyscall, such as `Thread` or `Path`,
  are in general imported directly from `rsyscall`;
  that is, with `from rsyscall import Thread`.
* Organization of syscalls
  In general, if a syscall takes some thing as its first argument in the POSIX interface to Linux,
  then in the rsyscall Python API it is a method on an object representing and owning that thing.

  - syscalls which operate on file descriptors are methods on file descriptor objects
  - syscalls which operate on existing memory mappings are methods on memory mapping objects
  - syscalls which operate on processes are methods on process objects

  These objects are returned from other syscalls that create them, and are garbage collected.
  For example, when the last reference to a file descriptor goes out of scope, the file descriptor is closed.
  The same applies for memory mappings, child processes, and other objects.
  It is also possible to manually close a file descriptor
  (or unmap a memory mapping, or kill a child process)
  if you want it to be deterministically closed.

  Syscalls which don't fit into another category are methods on the task object.
  This notably includes all syscalls operating on paths.
  We don't represent paths as an owned, garbage-collected object,
  primarily because the ownership and cleanup model of a path is not clear.

  Some syscalls can operate on multiple kinds of objects;
  for example, `kill` can operate on a process, but it can also operate on process groups.
  In such cases, all the objects which are valid targets for the syscall will have a method for the syscall;
  for example, there's a "kill" method on both Process and ProcessGroup[

  Consult the documentation for more detail on individual syscalls.
* Objects and helpers on Thread
  The "Thread" object contains several objects,
  along with some helper methods,
  which are useful in single-threaded operations.

  Some of the objects and methods on Thread are only relevant for multi-threaded operation;
  we won't cover those here.
** task: Task
   The Task is the low-level representation of a thread.
   All syscalls are either methods on the Task,
   or methods on objects returned by the Task.
** malloc/ptr and ram: RAM
   The RAM abstracts over memory and allows us to create pointers which can be passed to syscalls.

   It's what provides the malloc/ptr helpers that are directly accessible on a Thread.
** make_afd and epoller: Epoller
   The Epoller is an interface to epoll.
   In general, it won't be used directly;
   instead, you use it by passing a file descriptor to `thread.make_afd`,
   which registers that FD on the epoller and returns back an AsyncFileDescriptor
   which you can use to perform reads, writes, and other syscalls without blocking the thread.
** stdin/stdout/stderr: FileDescriptor
   These three traditional file descriptors are available as `thread.stdin`, `thread.stdout`, `thread.stderr`.
** Filesystem helpers
   There are a few repetitive tasks that crop up a lot in scripting.
   Making directories at some path, reading in an entire file, and writing out a file at some path with specific contents.

   `thread.mkdir`, `thread.read_to_eof` and `thread.spit` perform these operations without requiring you to deal with allocating memory.
** mktemp
   `thread.mktemp` returns a TemporaryDirectory,
   which has a field `path` which is the path to a fresh empty directory.

   This is not garbage-collected away,
   but `TemporaryDirectory` can be used as an async context manager yielding the path and cleaning up on exit,
   or you can explicitly call `await tmp_dir.cleanup()`.
* Spawning subprocesses
  Spawning subprocesses is a matter of the multi-threaded API.
  Read the [[file:multi_threaded.org][multi-threaded tutorial]] for information about that.
* Missing interfaces
We seek to provide user-accessible low-level interfaces to the entirety of the Linux kernel,
including all non-obsolete syscalls,
and including things that are typically considered low-level implementation details (for example, futexes).
If you want to use some feature of the Linux kernel that is missing an interface in rsyscall,
we're happy to add support for it, just file a feature request.
