"""Monitoring child processes in a non-blocking manner

The API for monitoring child processes is one of the worst-designed parts of
Unix, and Linux inherits that bad design. Still, we've tried to provide a usable
interface here.

Our basic approach is to use a signalfd waiting for SIGCHLD to learn when a
state change may have happened, then call waitid until we run out of state
changes. This is a common way to handle it, but we have a few changes.

Contrary to the obvious implementation, we don't use waitid(P.ALL).  Instead, we
make an individual waitid(P.PID) call for each process we're currently
monitoring for state changes.

P.ALL is unrecoverably broken and racy in many situations. It's fundamentally
the wrong API: You can't wait for only a subset of processes, you always have to
handle every single state change that could happen for any process. And worse:
When you handle the death state change for a child, that child pid is freed and
can be reused; so you must synchronize against anything that wants to operate on
child pids, to prevent pid wrap races.

P.ALL is especially bad when considering the possibility of new children
appearing.  If we call clone in two threads while a third calls waitid, and one
of the created child processes dies immediately, there is no way to prevent a
race where waitid gets the death state change before the second clone completes,
the pid wraps, the same pid is returned for the second clone, and we don't know
which child process is alive and which is dead. Similar races can happen if
we're pid 1 or a subreaper and we call clone.

Issuing a batch of P.PID calls instead is much better: We can wait for a subset
of pids, and so all these worries about races go away.  We still need to
synchronize between usage of the pid and calls to waitid, but that
synchronization happens for the individual child process, not globally across
all our child processes. And the implementation becomes much simpler: Each
object monitoring an individual child process just calls waitid(P.PID) and
checks the result, instead of having to wait on some central coordinator to call
waitid(P.ALL) and send back the state changes.

We also employ another trick: We use CLONE.PARENT to centralize child
monitoring.  When thread A creates child thread B, we want thread B to be able
to later create children of its own, e.g. process C.  Normally, we would create
a new signalfd in thread B so that it can monitor its children. Instead, when
thread B clones a new child process C, we use CLONE.PARENT so that thread A
becomes the parent of new child process C, then we monitor process C from thread
A instead of thread B.  This lowers the original creation cost of thread B
(since we don't have to make a new AsyncSignalfd, which would necessitate a new
epoller - see the docstring for AsyncSignalfd) and also improves the efficiency
of child monitoring through centralization into thread A.

    calling epoll_wait on that epollfd in another process.

    For us, this means that if we're using a signalfd for some
